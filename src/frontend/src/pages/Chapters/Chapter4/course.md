# Chapter 4: Get Play Money
#### Difficulty: **3/5** \| Estimated reading time: **3 min**

<dialog character="squid">Excellent, you have the first piece of equipment now. If you want to do anything in the blockchain waters rather than watching from the surface, you will need to dive into it, and you will need oxygen for that. ETH provides the gas you need to stay below the surface.</dialog>

**Get play money from a faucet.**
Faucets are places where it’s possible to get tokens for free. Usually, they hand play money, basically tokens that have no market value. Many developers use faucets to start building apps in a safe and free environment before launching them on the main network.

**We will use a faucet from Rinkeby, one of the main test nets for Ethereum.** The entire testnet uses play money, so the fees paid for transacting on the network do not represent any real financial value. Using free tokens in the Ethereum mainnet wouldn’t be smart because transaction fees would still be incurred in ETH, and therefore cost money. And you probably don’t want to pay fees while spending time on Ocean Academy.

Go to MetaMask and select Rinkeby Test Network in the upper central dropdown list. Your wallet address is the same as in the Ethereum Network, but everything is free to play now.

Go to the <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/" target="_blank" > Rikeby faucet </a> and follow the instructions provided.

You will be asked to post your ETH address on Twitter or Facebook; the faucet providers do this to ensure that people can do this just once and don’t empty the faucet too quickly.

Copy your ETH wallet address by clicking on ‘Account 1’, the default account created by Metamask. Clicking will automatically copy your wallet address to the clipboard. You can safely share this address with anyone because it is public and it does not control your funds (with your set-up only your Metamask and your seed phrase can control your funds).

Paste your ETH wallet address into a new tweet and post it publicly.
Being kind is optional but recommended :)

Paste a link to that post in the faucet and define how much you look to receive.
3 Ethers is enough for now. It all gets automatically confirmed.

Wait a few seconds, refresh, and there you are: you have 3 ETH in your wallet.

**You can also view the transaction on the blockchain** if you search for your wallet address via a Blockchain explorer like <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_blank" >Etherscan</a> .
Blockchain explorers are public tools (usable by anyone) that allow people to search through the blockchain and check all transactions.
If you have a spare minute go there and have a look, it’s nice to see ones’ transactions make history!
