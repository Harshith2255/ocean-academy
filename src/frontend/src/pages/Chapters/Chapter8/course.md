**Centralized computing.** While current high-end computers for end consumers can be quite powerful they are not powerful enough to train a big AI model like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165" target="_blank" >GPT-3</a>. Cloud computing provides a solution to this problem. It gives you access to a scalable computer system that is only limited by the speed of your internet connection and monetary resources, and in some cases legal access to these services.

Additionally, these powerful cloud computers are owned by a handful of companies that effectively decide what kind of computations are supported. They report that they will support whatever the industry needs, but we can’t neglect the fact that they are highly incentivized to support systems that strengthen their competitive or financial performance. A user is an entity with a satisfaction value which needs to be high enough so that they keep using their systems.

The advantages of a cloud computer should not be constrained to a few entities that can decide about how we think and compute data.

You might wonder if a cloud computer that is not owned by a single company could exist and here is the answer that might shock some of you: Yes. It exists. It’s working, and you can use it already. Its name is Ethereum.

**A decentralized computer**. We mentioned earlier that Ethereum adds the capability to execute programs on its blockchain. This effectively makes it a cloud computer that is owned by none and maintained by an open-source community. Everyone can deploy a program and everyone can execute it according to its rules. An independent piece of software code. This is called a smart contract. But we should not assume that this computer is efficient enough to do actual calculations. The execution speed is rather slow and expensive. This new computer does not replace cloud computers but enables a new infrastructure to utilize our resources in new ways. It enables novel approaches to deal with data, computation, and operate a business.
